# Kabaka's Terminus-Bot Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I have written for very specific use cases
in channels I run or help run, or for utility purposes on my server. They
won't be included in [the main repo](/Terminus-Project/Terminus-Bot/)'s script
section as they generally won't be useful to anyone else.
